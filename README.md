Joystick-mouse is a Human Interaction Device for controlling the mouse pointer with a joystick. The device is positioned below the keyboard and enables the user to do tasks like navigation and scrolling without taking his/her hands off the keyboard, providing a comfortable and ergonomic experience.

The java code for running Arduino Nano controlled joystick mouse to assist in making cursor movement  while typing, without having to leave the keyboard for the primary mouse. It's still in beta and lots of changes are needed. Very soon I am going to write an instructable chronicling the entire project.

Currently I have updated the prototype and now the project is using an ATTINY85. It can directly act as a HID device and has a micro-USB connector.
